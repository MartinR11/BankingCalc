# BankingCalc
CS 210 Project 2

This is my submission for the module 8 assignment. My code was used to calculate bank balances without a monthly deposit, calculate bank balances with a deposit, and format a table of values for display. One thing that I am particularly happying with is creating a separte file for a header and connceting this header file with my BankingCalc.cpp. This is something that took me longer to wrap my head around and felt good to see the code understand itself. Places like stack overflow and some generous people on youtube helped with some sysntax troubles throughout my code. Having an understanding of CPP is a transferable skill in itself, but knowing the layout of OOP like CPP is what I find to be even more helpful.
